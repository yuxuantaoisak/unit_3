# Unit 3: Tracker

## Criteria A: Planning


### Problem Definition


My client is a snowboard factory owner. He is passionate about making various kinds of snowboards for snowboarders of all levels. However, he recently encountered some problems with the management of his factory. Because of the increase in the number of clients, he is having some difficulties managing online orders. Besides, he does not like the shape and the design of the current model. He tried to write down order details and distribute these works to his employees everyday, but it does not work anymore with the huge increase in order numbers. If the problem keeps getting worse, my client faces consequences such as losing clients, reputation in the industry, and the customer loyalty that he just built recently.
